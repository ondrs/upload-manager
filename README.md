Upload manager for Nette framework

Installation
-----

composer.json

    "ondrs/upload-manager": "v8.0.0"

Configuration
-----

Register the extension:

```yaml
extensions:
    uploadManager: ondrs\UploadManager\DI\Extension
```

Minimal configuration:

```yaml
uploadManager:
    relativePath: '/uploads'
```

Full configuration:

```yaml
uploadManager:
    basePath: %wwwDir%
    relativePath: '/uploads'
    fileManager:
        blacklist: {php}
    imageManager:
        maxSize: 1280
        type: jpg
        quality: 80
        saveOriginal: FALSE
        dimensions:
            800:
                - {800, NULL}
                - shrink_only
            500:
                - {500, NULL}
                - shrink_only
            250:
                - {250, NULL}
                - shrink_only
            thumb:
                - {100, NULL}
                - shrink_only
```

In most cases you want to choose the `wwwDir` as your `basePath` (and it is chosen by default) to make your files publicly accessible.
`relativePath` is relative to the `basePath`, so complete path where your files will be uploaded looks like this

```
{basePath}/{relativePath}[/{dir}]
```

`dir` is an optional parameter and you can set it during the runtime of your script in the `listen()` or in the `upload()` method.

**fileManager:**
- blacklist
  - array of files extensions which are blacklisted, php is by default

**imageManager**
- maxSize
  - maximum size of an image, if its bigger, it will be automatically resized to this size
  - can be number X coord of an imahe
  - or array [X, Y]

- dimensions
  - array of dimensions to which an image will be resized
  - format is
    ```yaml
    PREFIX:
        - {X_SIZE, Y_SIZE}
        - RESIZE_OPTION
    ```

  - `PREFIX` can be whatever you want, it will be added to a resized file: `PREFIX_file.jpg`
  - `Y_SIZE` is optional as well as `RESIZE_OPTION`
  - `RESIZE_OPTION` is set to `Image::SHRINK_ONLY` by default

For example we will set the UploadManager according to the full configuration which is written above.

    $this->upload->filesToDir('dir/path')

Uploading an image file `foo.jpg` with size (1680 x 1050) will result in creation of 5 files: `foo.jpg, 800_foo.jpg, 500_.jpg, 250_foo.jpg, thumb_foo.jpg`
which will be saved in the `%wwwDir%/uploads/super/dir`
All files are resized proportionally according to their X dimension and saved with a corresponding prefix.
File foo.jpg is considered to be an original but it's resized to 1280px.

Usage
-----

Inject `ondrs\UploadManager\Upload` into your presenter or wherever you want

```php
/** @var \ondrs\UploadManager\Upload @inject
public $upload;
```

And do an upload.

```php
public function renderUpload()
{
    $this->upload->filesToDir('path/to/dir');
}
```

If you want to upload just a single file (for example with a form) call the `singleFileToDir()` method

```php
public function processForm($form)
{
    /** @var Nette\Http\FileUpload */
    $fileUpload = $form->values->file;

    $this->upload->singleFileToDir('path/to/dir', $fileUpload);
}
```

Events
-----

The real fun comes up with an events. They are here to help you to control and monitor your upload process with an ease.

- onQueueBegin
  - called before the upload starts
  - accept one argument
    1. array of Nette\Http\FileUpload objects which *will be uploaded*

- onQueueComplete
  - called when the upload finish
  - accept two arguments
    1. array of Nette\Http\FileUpload
    2. array of \SplFileInfo objects which *were uploaded*

- onFileBegin
  - called before the upload of *each file*
  - accept two arguments
    1. Nette\Http\FileUpload
    2. dir which is constructed as `{relativePath}[/{dir}]`

- onFileComplete
  - called after the upload complete of *each file*
  - accept three arguments
    1. Nette\Http\FileUpload object of the *original file*
    2. \SplFileInfo object of the *uploaded file*
    3. dir which is constructed as `{relativePath}[/{dir}]`


Real world example
-----

```php
/**
 * @param int $eventId
 */
public function uploadAttachment($eventId)
{
    /**
     * @param FileUpload $fileUpload
     * @param \SplFileInfo $uploadedFile
     * @param $path
     */
    $this->upload->onFileComplete[] = function (\SplFileInfo $uploadedFile, FileUpload $fileUpload, $path) use ($eventId) {

        $filename = $uploadedFile->getFilename();

        $this->db->table('crm_attachments')
            ->insert([
                'filename' => $filename,
                'path' => $path,
                'crm_events_id' => $eventId,
            ]);
    };

    /**
     * @param array $files
     * @param array $uploadedFiles
     */
    $this->upload->onQueueComplete[] = function(array $files, array $uploadedFiles) use($eventId) {

        $uploadedFiles = array_map(function($i) {
            return $i->getFilename();
        }, $uploadedFiles);

        $this->db->table('crm_events')
            ->wherePrimary($eventId)
            ->update([
                'text' => implode(';', $uploadedFiles),
            ]);
    };

    $this->upload->filesToDir('attachments/' . $eventId);
}
```
